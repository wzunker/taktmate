      }
    }
    I THINK THE ANSWER WAS TOO LONG SO IT GOT CONFUSED.
    ANSWER: To find the player who averaged the most points per game, divide points_scored by games_played for each player:

- Wilt Chamberlain: 3033 / 80 = 37.91
- Stephen Curry: 2987 / 76 = 39.30
- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: 2822 / 82 = 34.41
- Michael Jordan: 2580 / 82 = 31.46
- Kevin Durant: 2456 / 72 = 34.11
- Hakeem Olajuwon: 2356 / 82 = 28.73
- Kobe Bryant: 2323 / 78 = 29.78
- LeBron James: 2145 / 75 = 28.60
- Shaquille O'Neal: 2145 / 67 = 32.01
- Larry Bird: 2115 / 79 = 26.80
- Dirk Nowitzki: 2134 / 81 = 26.35
- Magic Johnson: 1834 / 77 = 23.82
- Tim Duncan: 1456 / 71 = 20.51
- Bill Russell: 1423 / 78 = 18.24

Stephen Curry averaged the most points per game: 39.30

    }
    IT GOT THE ANSWER RIGHT BUT WAS CONFUSED BY ALL OTHER NUMBERS
    ANSWER: To calculate the average field goal percentage:

Sum of field_goal_percentage:
0.497 + 0.525 + 0.449 + 0.506 + 0.520 + 0.496 + 0.582 + 0.559 + 0.540 + 0.440 + 0.512 + 0.473 + 0.498 + 0.471 = 7.068

Number of players: 14

Average = 7.068 / 14 = 0.505

Average field goal percentage across all players: 0.505 (or 50.5%)
