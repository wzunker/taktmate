# Takt Company Memo – Branding Document

---

## Why is it important

A strong brand is a unique identity—it’s what makes you memorable, builds trust, and gives people a sense of joy and comfort. Curating this brand carefully is critical so that customers and teammates alike understand Takt’s identity deeply and can champion it.

Consistency in our brand reflects attention to detail and professionalism. From a practical point of view, as we scale, new team members should have a source of truth to look to when creating and designing.

## Company Name: Takt

Our name, **Takt**, comes from “takt time”—the pace of production needed to meet customer demand. In German, takt also means beat, rhythm, or measure.

To us, it captures more than efficiency; it embodies the steady rhythm that keeps manufacturing moving forward. We chose this name because we aspire to be the heartbeat of reliable, efficient, and sustainable manufacturing.

## Company Logo

Our logo draws inspiration from the **Dirac delta function (δ(x))**, a cornerstone of engineering.

* Represents precision: the ability to capture exactly what matters, just as we aim to do with data.
* Symbolizes impulse: a spark that sets change in motion, reflecting our vision to disrupt and reimagine manufacturing.
* Its sibling, the **Heaviside step function (H(x) = ∫ δ(x) dx)**, represents a bold step forward, aligning with our belief that we are entering a new era of manufacturing powered by AI.
