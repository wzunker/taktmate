# Task List: TaktMate Online Hosting with Azure AD B2C Authentication

Based on PRD: `prd-online-hosting-authentication.md`

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TailwindCSS, simple component structure (App.jsx, FileUpload.jsx, ChatBox.jsx, DataTable.jsx)
- **Backend**: Express.js server with Azure OpenAI integration, in-memory file storage, CSV processing
- **Storage**: In-memory FileStore class, no database or persistent storage
- **Authentication**: None - currently localhost-only with no user management
- **Deployment**: Local development only (localhost:3000 frontend, localhost:3001 backend)

### Key Components to Leverage
- Existing CSV upload/processing pipeline (FileUpload.jsx, processCsv.js)
- Azure OpenAI integration (already configured with GPT-4.1)
- Chat interface (ChatBox.jsx with message handling)
- Clean UI components with TailwindCSS styling

### Major Additions Required
- Azure AD B2C authentication integration
- Azure cloud deployment infrastructure
- Landing/marketing page
- Azure Application Insights monitoring
- Session management with Azure AD B2C tokens
