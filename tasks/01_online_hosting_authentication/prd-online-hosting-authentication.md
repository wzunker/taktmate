# Product Requirements Document: TaktMate Online Hosting with User Authentication

## Introduction/Overview

Transform the TaktMate CSV chat application from a localhost-only tool into a cloud-hosted platform accessible to users worldwide. This feature will add comprehensive user authentication, account management, and professional online hosting while preserving the core CSV analysis functionality powered by Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1.

**Problem Statement**: Currently, TaktMate only runs locally, limiting its accessibility and preventing users from accessing their CSV analysis capabilities from multiple devices or sharing the tool with others.

**Goal**: Create a professional, publicly accessible web platform that allows users to sign up, log in, and use TaktMate's CSV analysis features from anywhere, while maintaining the same performance and functionality as the local version.

## Goals

1. **Global Accessibility**: Make TaktMate available to users worldwide through professional web hosting
2. **User Authentication**: Implement secure, user-friendly authentication with multiple login options
3. **Account Management**: Provide basic user profile management and session handling
4. **Seamless Migration**: Preserve all existing CSV upload and AI chat functionality
5. **Professional Presence**: Establish TaktMate as a credible, professional SaaS tool
6. **Security & Privacy**: Implement GDPR compliance and comprehensive data protection
7. **Scalable Foundation**: Build infrastructure that can support future feature expansions

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
1. **As a new user**, I want to easily discover TaktMate's capabilities through a marketing page so that I can understand the value before signing up.
2. **As a potential user**, I want multiple convenient signup options (Google, Microsoft, or email/password) so that I can choose my preferred authentication method.
3. **As a registered user**, I want to securely log into my account and stay logged in for 7 days so that I don't have to repeatedly authenticate.
4. **As an authenticated user**, I want to upload CSV files and chat with my data exactly like the local version so that I get the same powerful analysis capabilities.
5. **As a privacy-conscious user**, I want my data to be handled securely with GDPR compliance and the ability to export/delete my data.

### Secondary User Stories
6. **As a business user**, I want to access TaktMate from any device so that I can analyze data whether I'm in the office or traveling.
7. **As a security-conscious user**, I want my session to be secure and automatically expire appropriately so that my account remains protected.
8. **As a user**, I want my uploaded CSV files to be private and not shared with other users so that my data remains confidential.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication & User Management

4. The system must implement standard password requirements: 8+ characters with mixed case, numbers, and special characters.
5. The system must provide email verification for email/password registrations.
6. The system must create and manage user profiles with basic view-only information (name, company, role, email).
7. The system must implement session management with 7-day duration and "Remember me" functionality.
8. The system must provide secure logout functionality that properly terminates sessions.

### Hosting & Infrastructure
9. The system must be deployed on Azure cloud services using Azure Static Web Apps for frontend and Azure App Service for backend.
10. The system must use Azure SQL Database for user account and session management.

13. The system must maintain all existing CSV upload functionality (5MB limit) within authenticated user sessions.
14. The system must preserve all existing AI chat capabilities using Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1 integration.

### Data Management & Privacy
15. The system must handle CSV files as session-only data (files deleted when user logs out or session expires).
16. The system must keep all user data private with no sharing capabilities between users.
17. The system must implement GDPR compliance including user data export and deletion capabilities.
18. The system must provide secure data transmission (HTTPS) for all user interactions.
19. The system must protect API endpoints and require authentication for access to CSV functionality.

### Performance & Usability
20. The system must maintain performance matching the current localhost experience.
21. The system must provide seamless transition from registration/login to CSV analysis functionality.
22. The system must be responsive and accessible from desktop and mobile devices.
23. The system must handle user sessions gracefully with appropriate error messages and recovery options.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Advanced Profile Management**: Detailed profile editing, avatar uploads, or extensive user preferences
2. **File Storage & Management**: Persistent file storage, file organization, or file management systems
3. **File Sharing**: Any ability to share CSV files or analysis results with other users
4. **Usage Restrictions**: API rate limiting, usage quotas, or premium account tiers
5. **Advanced Analytics**: User behavior tracking, usage analytics, or business intelligence features
6. **Multi-tenancy**: Organization accounts, team management, or collaborative features
7. **Custom Branding**: White-label solutions or custom branding for different organizations
8. **Advanced Security**: Multi-factor authentication, advanced audit logging, or enterprise security features
9. **Multiple Environments**: Development or staging environments (production only initially)
10. **Advanced Database Features**: Complex data relationships, advanced queries, or database optimization

## Design Considerations

### Landing Page
- Clean, professional design explaining TaktMate's CSV analysis capabilities
- Prominent "Sign Up" and "Log In" buttons
- Brief feature overview with key benefits highlighted
- Consistent branding that can evolve with future taktconnect.com domain migration

### Authentication Interface

- OAuth integrations table for Google/Microsoft authentication tokens

### Security Implementation
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications
- Secure session token generation and validation
- Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms (bcrypt)
- CSRF protection for form submissions
- Input validation and sanitization for all user data

### Migration Considerations

4. Should we plan database schema to accommodate future features like file storage, sharing, or team accounts?

### User Experience
5. Should we implement any onboarding flow or tutorial for new users after registration?
6. Do we need any admin interface for user management or system monitoring initially?

### Technical Implementation
7. Should we use Azure AD B2C for authentication or implement custom OAuth integration?
