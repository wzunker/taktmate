# UI/UX Workflow Overhaul - Three-Panel Layout Implementation

## Overview
This checklist implements a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul transitioning TaktMate from the current file-centric workflow to a project-based three-panel layout with enhanced onboarding and workflow guidance.

### Current State Analysis
- **Current Layout**: Sources Panel (left) + ChatBox (center) + DataTable (right)
- **Current Workflow**: File upload â†’ File selection â†’ Chat creation â†’ Data preview
- **Current Issues**: No project organization, confusing onboarding, data preview conflicts with chat focus

### Target State Vision
- **New Layout**: Projects & Files (left) + Conversations (center) + ChatBox (right)
- **New Workflow**: Project creation/selection â†’ File management â†’ Conversation creation â†’ Multi-file chat analysis
- **Key Improvements**: Project organization, guided onboarding, disabled data preview, multi-file conversation support

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Backend Updates

### 1.1 Project Management Backend
- [x] **Create Project API Endpoints**
  - [x] `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
  - [x] `GET /api/projects` - List user projects
  - [x] `GET /api/projects/:id` - Get specific project details
  - [x] `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (rename)
  - [x] `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project and associated data
  - [x] `GET /api/projects/:id/files` - Get files in project
  - [x] `GET /api/projects/:id/conversations` - Get project conversations

- [x] **Update Database Schema (Cosmos DB)**
  - [x] Add `projects` container with partition key `/userId`
  - [x] Update `conversations` container to include `projectId` field
  - [x] Add `files` metadata container linking files to projects
  - [x] Create indexes for efficient project-based queries

- [x] **Update File Management**
  - [x] Modify file upload to require `projectId` parameter
  - [x] Update Azure Blob Storage structure: `users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}/files/`
  - [x] Update file deletion to handle project-based storage paths
  - [x] Add file-to-project association tracking

### 1.2 Enhanced Conversation Management
- [ ] **Multi-File Conversation Support**
  - [ ] Update conversation creation to accept multiple `fileIds`

- [ ] **Conversation-Project Linking**
  - [ ] Add `projectId` field to conversation records
  - [ ] Update conversation queries to filter by project
  - [ ] Implement project-level conversation management

### 1.3 User State Management
- [ ] **Project Session State**
  - [ ] Track user's current active project in session/localStorage
  - [ ] Implement project switching with state preservation
  - [ ] Add project-level user preferences storage
