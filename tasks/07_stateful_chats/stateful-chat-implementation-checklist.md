# üó£Ô∏è Stateful Chat Memory Implementation Checklist

## Overview
Transform TaktMate from stateless single-turn conversations to persistent multi-turn conversations with intelligent memory management using Azure Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, and OpenAI summarization.

## Current State Analysis
- **Current Architecture**: Stateless chat - each message is independent
- **File Management**: Azure Blob Storage with user isolation
- **Authentication**: Entra ID with user session management
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1
- **Frontend**: React with ChatBox component for single-turn interactions

## Target Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: Azure Cosmos DB for active conversation metadata and recent messages
- **Archive Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for full conversation transcripts
- **Summarization**: Azure OpenAI for conversation summaries when conversations grow large
- **Hybrid Approach**: Fast access to recent messages + on-demand full history retrieval
