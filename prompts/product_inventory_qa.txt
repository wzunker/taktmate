I have added a new file, `product_inventory_qa.json`. Please generate additional questions based on the corresponding CSV file. Include a mix of **structured** and **unstructured/semantic** questions.

* For **structured questions**, use any of the following operations:
  `min, max, greater_equal, greater, less_equal, less, equals, not_equal, sum, average, count, before_date, after_date, between_dates, latest_n, earliest_n, sort_asc, sort_desc, contains, not_contains`.

* Avoid using overly common phrasing; vary language and try less typical wording or symbolic representations where appropriate.

* Review the other existing qa.json files to ensure consistent structure and to make sure there is a good diversity of questions. Diversity here means a good representation of all the structured question types above.

* Make sure it possible to run an evaluations for the new individual file, e.g., `npm run eval:product_inventory`.
